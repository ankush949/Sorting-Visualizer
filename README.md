# Sorting-Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a Python project built using Tkinter that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It supports algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, allowing users to observe how elements are rearranged step-by-step. Users can customize the array size and control the sorting speed for a more interactive experience. To run the project, clone the repository, install the required packages, and execute main.py to launch the application. Once running, users can select their preferred algorithm, set parameters, and visualize the sorting process. Each algorithm works uniquelyâ€”Bubble Sort swaps adjacent elements, Selection Sort places the smallest element in order, Insertion Sort builds a sorted array incrementally, Merge Sort divides and merges subarrays, and Quick Sort partitions and sorts using a pivot. Future updates aim to introduce additional algorithms and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Contributions to improve and expand the project are welcome!
